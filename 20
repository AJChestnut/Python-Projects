# Assignment 20:
# Write a program that gets the root document ("/") from *****.edu and extracts every 
# line that has an anchor tag, indicating that it's a hyperlink to another page. The anchor tag
# will start with <a so you can search for that. Ideally, include a space after the a so you only 
# get the anchor tags. 

# Create a Sqlite database sending in the following query at the beginning of your program if 
# the database doesn't exist (use the os module to check to see if a file exists). 

CREATE TABLE storage(curtime TEXT, line TEXT)

You can use the following query to insert values into the database:

INSERT INTO storage (curtime, line) values ('', line);

# With appropriate values for your values. You will need to create a string by concatenating your
# values before you pass the INSERT statement into the execute method. There are a number of ways
# to do this, so be sure to look up examples online. You should be getting the current time each 
# time you enter a value into the database and pass that in for the value of curtime. The following
# will get you the current time with high precision. 

# import datetime

# current_time = datetime.datetime.now().time()

# Use all the same documentation requirements you have been using and submit your program here. 

# NOTE: This assignment used to have you connect to www.*****.edu but that site now redirects to
# HTTPS and our http connection in Python won't work right.

# This assignment was a little difficult. It involved combining several different things we had learned
# into one script.
