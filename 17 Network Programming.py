# Assignemnt 17:

# This week, you are going to build on the program from last week. Use the same file from last week. 
# You will be extracting the first partition entry from the master boot record that is contained in 
# the file. The first partition entry starts at offset 0x1BE and ends at 0x1CD. Pull that chunk of 
# bytes out of the file provided and send it to the server software that you will write. The server 
# will listen for the chunk of data and print out the status of the drive, the partition type and 
# the starting address of the partition as an integer. 

# You can refer to Wikipedia (Links to an external site.) for additional details about offsets within 
# the master boot record and partition table for the pieces of information you are looking for.
